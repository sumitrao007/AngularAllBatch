- Used for status & Validity
-we have to use multiple properties
 1 valid -is valid
 2 invalid - is  invalid
 3 dirty- You typed in that element it is called dirty
 4 pristine - we not touched that field or HTML element,also it is called clean means you do not type any thing in that.

-Template Driven form is used as directive level status & Validation
 -with minimal compoenet code
 - Easy to use
 - Suitable for simple scenarios and fails for complex scenarios 
 - Automatic track of the form & its data
- Template driven form used directive

 - The NgModel directive creates the FormControl Instance (angular creates control object) to manage the template form control
- when we use ngModel directives we must use 'name ' attribute given by HTML, it is required for ngModel
 - ngModel directive holds the control, that you created for the element and name attribute, also it monitors their properties, including their validity
- Also Use "required" attribute given by html on that basis we check the error is there or not
